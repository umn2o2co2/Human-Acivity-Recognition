# Human-Acivity-Recognition

Abstract:

With advancement in the field of health and medicine, new and better sensors are being developed which help monitor various aspects of an individual's health. To provide the users with effective analysis related to their health using these sensors, an optimized and accurate solution is required.

The global fitness tracker market is expected to grow significantly over the forecast period, 2017-2023. Academic segment of fitness tracker market globally drives the market majorly due to growing awareness about health. Fitness tracker encourage people to walk more. Its user-friendly feature increases convenience to carry it all the time.

The main objective of this study is to analyze various machine learning algorithms which will use the data provided by these sensors and extrapolate information from this data which will be useful in tracking the physical activities of a user. We study two different research papers already published on this subject and try to improve the methods used and the results shown in those papers. We will implement and perform a comparative study of different algorithms to find the most accurate one.

In this paper we will develop a method to recognize and track a userâ€™s daily activities using only their smartphones without any need for an additional fitness tracker device. Most smartphones have sensors such as Accelerometers and Gyroscope sensors. We will use only this limited amount of data to predict what kind of activity such as walking, running, climbing etc. a user is currently doing. 

We will implement algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, 1-D Convolution Neural Networks and LSTMs. We compare the results of these algorithms and find out which Algorithm works the best for our model. Our dataset consists of 6 output classes like Walking, Jogging, climbing upstairs and downstairs, Standing and Sitting. In order to use our product, the users must have a smartphone with the required sensor whose values are used to predict the various physical activities.
